# simple-blockchain

Thought it would be fun to create a simple blockchain using Python. I also followed this neat tutorial which can be found here. I made some minor adjustments to the code, and the resolving node doesn't work correct so in my next commmit
I will probably have to look into why it isn't working like it should. 

Eventually I will create a docker container and host this application on elastic beanstalk.
